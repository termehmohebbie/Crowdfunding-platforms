# Crowdfunding-platforms

## Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
The most successful campaigns are plays in “theater” category. After that, “film & video” and “music” campaigns were more successful.
56% of the total campaigns were successful, 37% were failed and less than 6% were canceled.
The overall performance of successful campaigns was higher in June and July.

## What are some limitations of this dataset?
We only have access to 7 countries and 10 years of data. Differences in the currencies make some calculations less accurate or too hard to perform.

## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
We can use pie charts to have a better view of each category’s overall performance. We can also try to find what other variables could possibly have any impact on the success of a campaign such as the country, the length of the campaign, having the project on spotlight web page, being picked by the Kickstarter staff, etc. We can plot different scatterplots to find relations between any of these variables and a campaign’s success.


## **Bonus**
After plotting the box plot for successful and failed campaigns, we can see there are many outliers in this data set, so we can say the median is a better measure, but the minimum and maximum are very far from each other and the range is wide.
By looking at the IQR or size of the box we can understand that half of our observations are so close to the median and their values are not too far from each other, so our data is more consistent.
